<!-- DATES and what changed/was accomplished on that day. -->

3.31.21:
- Learned about IF and ELSE.
- Learned Switches.
- Learned about Dynamic Declaration.
- Set up repository for this little program.
- Updated README.
- [001-0.0.1]:: INITIAL COMMIT >> Updated readme, added icon, created base file.
- [002-0.0.2]:: Code Addition >> Fixed the core program file extension so it's actually a c++ file. Added the beginnings of the program in the form of getting player name, and player class. Attempted input validation but not currently skilled enough.
- [003-0.0.3]:: Code Addition >> Added a small combat phase with various dialogues depending on player choice in class and move. Hopefully this demonstrates a sufficient use of conditional logic. I chose to stop here to recognize that more complicated programs require more sophisticated manipulation of data and functions, not more IF statements!
